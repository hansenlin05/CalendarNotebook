# Calendar Notebook Project

## *Proposal*
The application is a Java-based application of the calendar notebook, calendar notebook with basic browsing and date modification functions . The notebook has basic functions such as input, save, delete, view and so on.

With the development of society, more and more people rely on laptops to work and live especially college students. This means that it is not convenient to make records on paper calendars to carry around, nor is it convenient to change and manage them in time. Given that the laptop as an electronic tool that most college students carry with them on a daily basis and the default application of the computer does not exist to combine the calendar and notepad, the calendar notepad application can help college students or experimental staff to combine the date to record logs or manage schedules and memos. I made this project because I was working on my laptop and I wanted to see the calendar but I couldn't see the schedule or timetable for that date, and the only way to do that was to use an online tool such as Google Calendar, which can't be done with a local offline tool. I wanted to implement this feature through Java and that's why I developed this application.
